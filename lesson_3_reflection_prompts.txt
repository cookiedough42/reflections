Q1: When would you want to use a remote repository 
    rather than keeping all your work local?
    
A1: For example when I want to work on multiple
    devices or together with other devs.
	

Q2: Why might you want to always pull changes 
	manually rather than having Git automatically 
	stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
A2: For example when I made changes and have to 
	interrupt coding and the change is not ready yet,
	so I don't want it to be public until it is 
	finished the manually push-pull thing is better. 


Q3: Describe the differences between forks, clones, 
	and branches. When would you use one instead of 
	another?
