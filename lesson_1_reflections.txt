How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file 
help you see the bug that was introduced?

It helped me because i didnot have to check all the text,
but only the changes.
I just had to compare the changed lines.
Thanks a lot, diff! :)



How could having easy access to the entire history of 
a file make you a more efficient programmer in the 
long term?

If I do so, I would be able to use earlier, 
maybe not so specific versions of a file for other projects.
I also could backup old versions, if the newer version 
of the file has errors.
Its a kind of backup.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, 
allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, 
like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because somebody said so.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view 
the history of files?

"git log" is usefull to see what is committed. 
It lists the history of commited files, together with an 
ID and a comment to identify the version.
"git diff" allows to compare two versions of a file. 
It shows the changed lines.


How might using version control make you more confident 
to make changes that could break something?

By using vc I can switch backwards in versions, when i 
found a "break" to find out since when it is in the file
and i can compare different versions for better finding 
the mistake.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you 
want to try using Git for?

For all the cool stuff it was made for.
